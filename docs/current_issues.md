# Current Issues

## Input
Currently, inputs are not registered in any way. UART can send data, but it will not be received and handled by the system. Need to implement shift register to handle it.


## ALU
Everything...


## Grapher
VGA output is offset horizontally, though the vertical part seems fine.
